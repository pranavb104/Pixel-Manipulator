# Pixel-Manipulator
An openframeworks snippet to calculate and manipulate existing pixels of an image

This program does not use shaders or the GPU to store and read pixels. It uses a simple iterator to read each pixel and checks the condition/color at each instance. 

Would love to see implementation of shaders to make the process faster and robust.
